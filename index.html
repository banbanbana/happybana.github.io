        		<h1>Hi!</h1>
				<p>I’m a graphic designer from Cincinnati. Since I got my first copy of Adobe Photoshop 4.5 in 1999, I have been obsessed with design. What started as an all-consuming hobby building websites, and making posters for myself and friends became a career doing the same for national brands like Kroger, Time, Inc. and Chico’s. I’ve been working professionally for nearly 6 years, have refined my taste and learned to balance the needs and desires of the client with the restrictions, requirements, and objectives of the project at hand. This eye for balance allows me to deliver pixel-perfection across mediums and on any screen.</a></p>
